	<h1> Cyber Security</h1>

	<p>
		Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
<br>
The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". Owing to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.

<h3>History : </h3>

<p>
	The April 1967 session organized by Willis Ware at the Spring Joint Computer Conference, and the later publication of the Ware Report, were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security.[4] Ware's work straddled the intersection of material, cultural, political, and social concerns.[4]
<br>
A 1977 NIST publication[5] introduced the "CIA triad" of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals.[6] While still relevant, many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposed.

<h3>Failed offensive strategy : </h3>
<br>
<br>

<p>
	The National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for both the protection of U.S. information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence.[9] These two duties are in conflict with each other. Protecting information systems includes evaluating software, identifying security flaws, and taking steps to correct the flaws, which is a defensive action. Collecting intelligence includes exploiting security flaws to extract information, which is an offensive action. Correcting security flaws makes the flaws unavailable for NSA exploitation.
<br>
<br>
The agency analyzes commonly used software in order to find security flaws, which it reserves for offensive purposes against competitors of the United States. The agency seldom takes defensive action by reporting the flaws to software producers so they can eliminate the security flaws.[10]
<br>
<br>

The offensive strategy worked for a while, but eventually other nations, including Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China have acquired their own offensive capability, and tend to use it against the United States. NSA contractors created and sold "click-and-shoot" attack tools to U.S. agencies and close allies, but eventually the tools made their way to foreign adversaries. In 2016, NSAs own hacking tools were hacked and have been used by Russia and North Korea. NSAs employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries, anxious to compete in cyberwarfare.[10]
<br>
<br>

For example, in 2007, the United States and Israel began exploiting security flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in Iran to refine nuclear materials. Iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability, which they began using against the United States.

<h3>Vulnerabilities and attacks : </h3>
<br>
<br>

<p>

A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation, or internal control. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or "exploit" exists.[11] Vulnerabilities can be researched, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited using automated tools or customized scripts.[12][13] To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these threats can typically be classified into one of these categories below:
<br>
<br>
<b>Backdoor  </b>
<br>
A backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. They may exist for many reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability. Backdoors can be very hard to detect, and detection of backdoors are usually discovered by someone who has access to application source code or intimate knowledge of Operating System of the computer.

<br>
<br>

<b>Denial-of-service attack  </b>
<br>

Denial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.[14] Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim's account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques, including reflection and amplification attacks, where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

<br>
<br>
<b>Direct-access attacks  </b>

An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless microphone. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks.
<br>
<br>

<b>Eavesdropping  </b>
<br>
Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer "conversation" (communication), typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware; TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.
<br>
<br>
<b>Multi-vector, polymorphic attacks  </b>
<br>
Surfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,[15] polymorphic[16] cyber threats combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread.
<br>
<br>

<b>Phishing  </b>
<br>
Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users.[17] Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose "look" and "feel" are almost identical to the legitimate one. The fake website often asks for personal information, such as log-in details and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering. Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts. A common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices[18] to individuals showing that they recently purchased music, apps, or other, and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized.

<br>
<br>

<b>Privilege escalation  </b>
<br>
Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become "root" and have full unrestricted access to a system.
<br>
<br>

<b>Reverse engineering  </b>
<br>

Reverse engineering is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, code, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon.
<br>
<br>

<b>Social engineering </b>
<br>

Social engineering, in the context of computer security, aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. or grant physical access by, for example, impersonating a senior executive, bank, a contractor, or a customer.[20] This generally involves exploiting peoples trust, and relying on their cognitive biases. A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel, impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action. In early 2016, the FBI reported that such "business email compromise" (BEC) scams had cost US businesses more than $2 billion in about two years.
<br>

In May 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president Peter Feigin, resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 W-2 tax forms.

<br>
<br>
<b>Spoofing </b>
<br>
Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data (such as an IP address or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.[23][24] There are several types of spoofing, including:
<br>

1.Email spoofing, where an attacker forges the sending (From, or source) address of an email.
<br>
2.IP address spoofing, where an attacker alters the source IP address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.
<br>
3.MAC spoofing, where an attacker modifies the Media Access Control (MAC) address of their network interface to obscure their identity, or to pose as another.
<br>
4.Biometric spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Tampering </b>
<br>
Tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data. So-called Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples.
<br>
<br>


<b>Malware : </b>
Malicious software (malware) installed on a computer can leak personal information, can give control of the system to the attacker and can delete data permanently.
<br>

<h3>Information security culture : </h3>

<p>
	Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. Information security culture is the "...totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kinds."[28]
<br>
Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organization's information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes.[29] Indeed, the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2020, which examined 3,950 security breaches, discovered 30% of cyber security incidents involved internal actors within a company.[30] Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In ″Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change″, authors commented, ″It's a never-ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.″ To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.<br>
<br>
i.Pre-evaluation: To identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies.<br>
ii.Strategic planning: To come up with a better awareness program, clear targets need to be set. Assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it.<br>
iii.Operative planning: A good security culture can be established based on internal communication, management-buy-in, security awareness and a training program.<br>
iv.Implementation: Four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are:<br>
1.Commitment of the management.<br>
2.Communication with organizational members.<br>
3.Courses for all organizational members.<br>
4.Commitment of the employees.<br>
Post-evaluation: To assess the success of the planning and implementation, and to identify unresolved areas of concern.

<h3>Systems at risk : </h3>
<br>
<p>
	The growth in the number of computer systems and the increasing reliance upon them by individuals, businesses, industries, and governments means that there is an increasing number of systems at risk.
	<br>
	<br>
</p>

<b>Financial systems</b>
<br>
<p>
	The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SWIFT, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains.[32] Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers, brokerage accounts, and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the black market.[33] In-store payment systems and ATMs have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and PINs.
