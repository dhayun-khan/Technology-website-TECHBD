	<h1> Internet Of Things</h1>

	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>

<p>
	The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—a.k.a. "things"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
	<br>
	<br>

Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.[5]
<br>
<br>
There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of international standards.
<br>

<h3>History : </h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>

The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first Internet-connected appliance,[6] able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not.[7] Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.[8][9] In 1994, Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories".[10] Between 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed solutions like Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. The field gained momentum when Bill Joy envisioned device-to-device communication as a part of his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999.
<br>
<br>

The term "Internet of things" was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999,[12] though he prefers the phrase "Internet for things".[13] At that point, he viewed radio-frequency identification (RFID) as essential to the Internet of things,[14] which would allow computers to manage all individual things.[15][16][17]
<br>
<br>

Defining the Internet of things as "simply the point in time when more 'things or objects' were connected to the Internet than people", Cisco Systems estimated that the IoT was "born" between 2008 and 2009, with the things/people ratio growing from 0.08 in 2003 to 1.84 in 2010.

<h3> Applications : </h3>
<br>
<br>
<P>
	The extensive set of applications for IoT devices[19] is often divided into consumer, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure spaces.
	<br>
	<b>Consumer applications </b>
	<br>
	A growing portion of IoT devices are created for consumer use, including connected vehicles, home automation, wearable technology, connected health, and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities.
	<br>

	<b>Smart home </b>

IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.[23][24] Long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the home aware of usage.[25]
<br>
A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances.[26] For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.[27][28] This could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.[29] This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo's Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.[29] There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.[30] In addition to the commercial systems, there are many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.
<br>
<br>

<b>Elder care</b>
<br>
One key application of a smart home is to provide assistance for those with disabilities and elderly individuals. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner's specific disabilities.[33] Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing-impaired users.[34] They can also be equipped with additional safety features. These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or seizures.[35] Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of life.[33]
<br>
The term "Enterprise IoT" refers to devices used in business and corporate settings. By 2019, it is estimated that the EIoT will account for 9.1 billion devices.

<h3>Organizational applications : </h3>
<b>Medical and healthcare : </b>
<p>
	The <b>Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)</b>
	is an application of the IoT for medical and health related purposes, data collection and analysis for research, and monitoring.[36][37][38][39][40] The IoMT has been referenced as "Smart Healthcare",[41] as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system, connecting available medical resources and healthcare services.[citation needed][42]
<br>
<br>
IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing aids.[43] Some hospitals have begun implementing "smart beds" that can detect when they are occupied and when a patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support is applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses.[36] A 2015 Goldman Sachs report indicated that healthcare IoT devices "can save the United States more than $300 billion in annual healthcare expenditures by increasing revenue and decreasing cost."[44] Moreover, the use of mobile devices to support medical follow-up led to the creation of 'm-health', used analyzed health statistics." [45]
<br>
<br>
Specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being of senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people regain lost mobility via therapy as well.[46] These sensors create a network of intelligent sensors that are able to collect, process, transfer, and analyze valuable information in different environments, such as connecting in-home monitoring devices to hospital-based systems.[41] Other consumer devices to encourage healthy living, such as connected scales or wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the IoT.[47] End-to-end health monitoring IoT platforms are also available for antenatal and chronic patients, helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirements.[48]
<br>
<br>
Advances in plastic and fabric electronics fabrication methods have enabled ultra-low cost, use-and-throw IoMT sensors. These sensors, along with the required RFID electronics, can be fabricated on paper or e-textiles for wireless powered disposable sensing devices.[49] Applications have been established for point-of-care medical diagnostics, where portability and low system-complexity is essential.[50]
<br>
<br>
As of 2018 IoMT was not only being applied in the clinical laboratory industry,[38] but also in the healthcare and health insurance industries. IoMT in the healthcare industry is now permitting doctors, patients, and others, such as guardians of patients, nurses, families, and similar, to be part of a system, where patient records are saved in a database, allowing doctors and the rest of the medical staff to have access to patient information.[51] Moreover, IoT-based systems are patient-centered, which involves being flexible to the patient's medical conditions.[citation needed] IoMT in the insurance industry provides access to better and new types of dynamic information. This includes sensor-based solutions such as biosensors, wearables, connected health devices, and mobile apps to track customer behaviour. This can lead to more accurate underwriting and new pricing models.[52]
<br>
<br>

The application of the IoT in healthcare plays a fundamental role in managing chronic diseases and in disease prevention and control. Remote monitoring is made possible through the connection of powerful wireless solutions. The connectivity enables health practitioners to capture patient's data and applying complex algorithms in health data analysis.[53]
<br>
<br>

<b>Transportation </b>
<br>
The IoT can assist in the integration of communications, control, and information processing across various transportation systems. Application of the IoT extends to all aspects of transportation systems (i.e. the vehicle,[54] the infrastructure, and the driver or user). Dynamic interaction between these components of a transport system enables inter- and intra-vehicular communication,[55] smart traffic control, smart parking, electronic toll collection systems, logistics and fleet management, vehicle control, safety, and road assistance.

<br>
<br>

<b>V2X communications </b>

<br>
In vehicular communication systems, vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X), consists of three main components: vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure communication (V2I) and vehicle to pedestrian communications (V2P). V2X is the first step to autonomous driving and connected road infrastructure.

<br>
<br>

<h3>Building and home automation : </h3>
<br>

IoT devices can be used to monitor and control the mechanical, electrical and electronic systems used in various types of buildings (e.g., public and private, industrial, institutions, or residential)[43] in home automation and building automation systems. In this context, three main areas are being covered in literature:
<br>

1.The integration of the Internet with building energy management systems in order to create energy efficient and IOT-driven "smart buildings".<br>
2.The possible means of real-time monitoring for reducing energy consumption[25] and monitoring occupant behaviors.<br>
3.The integration of smart devices in the built environment and how they might be used in future applications.<br>

<br>
<br>

<b>Industrial applications</b>

<br>
Also known as IIoT, industrial IoT devices acquire and analyze data from connected equipment, operational technology (OT), locations and people. Combined with operational technology (OT) monitoring devices, IIoT helps regulate and monitor industrial systems. Also, the same implementation can be carried out for automated record updates of asset placement in industrial storage units as the size of the assets can vary from a small screw till the whole motor spare part and misplacement of such assets can cause a percentile loss of manpower time and money.
<br>
<br>

<b>Manufacturing </b>
<br>

The IoT can connect various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing, communication, actuation, and networking capabilities.[58] Network control and management of manufacturing equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control allow IoT to be used for industrial applications and smart manufacturing.[59] IoT intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing and optimization of new products, and rapid response to product demands.<br>

Digital control systems to automate process controls, operator tools and service information systems to optimize plant safety and security are within the purview of the IIoT.[60] IoT can also be applied to asset management via predictive maintenance, statistical evaluation, and measurements to maximize reliability.[61] Industrial management systems can be integrated with smart grids, enabling energy optimization. Measurements, automated controls, plant optimization, health and safety management, and other functions are provided by networked sensors.

<br>
<br>

<b>Agriculture : </b>

<br>
There are numerous IoT applications in farming[62] such as collecting data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, and soil content. This data can be used to automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, minimise risk and waste, and reduce effort required to manage crops. For example, farmers can now monitor soil temperature and moisture from afar, and even apply IoT-acquired data to precision fertilisation programs.[63]
<br>

In August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for IoT technologies related to water management. Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms.[64]

<br>
<br>

<b>Maritime</b>

<br>
IoT devices are in use monitoring the environments and systems of boats and yachts.[65] Many pleasure boats are left unattended for days in summer, and months in winter so such devices provide valuable early alert of boat flooding, fire, and deep discharge of batteries. The use of global internet data networks such as Sigfox, combined with long life batteries, and microelectronics allows the engine rooms, bilge, and batteries to be constanted monitored and reported to a connected Android & Apple applications for example.
