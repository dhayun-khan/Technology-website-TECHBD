<h3>The XaaS importance to the business digitalization : </h3>

<p>
	Technological origins of most of XaaS cloud microservices is close to the software-as-a-service SaaS model. The consumer of the cloud-service can choose and install applications and services which he needs to use in the cloud — data backup and recovering, content management, database, cloud storage, communications, monitoring, backend, payments, and even malware. XaaS assortment is constantly updated with new items. And even if the provider cannot to the customer a XaaS developed by the provider, it is no problem: integration with the service of another vendor is often possible — the clouds allow it.
	<br>
	<br>

The XaaS approach is highly correlated with BYOD, bring-your-own-device, a corporate IT management model, without which it is now difficult to imagine any modern company. Under this model, company employees use their own devices — smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, laptops — to access the corporate information system. The problem of reducing the level of information security within the BYOD model was solved by the concept of access and management of the company’s IT resources through APIs. Some companies on the market offer customers to use API-as-a-Service.
<br>
<br>

Digital transformation forms particular demands on the organization of business processes, and the XaaS concept is fully complying with them. Business benefits from XaaS are costs and risk reduction, process and staff optimization, regular support, and updates by the provider, flexibility in cost forecasting, and management. Also, serious providers always bear financial liabilities to customers, pointed in the Service Level Agreement, a document that describes the quality assurance of the delivered services.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Various types of cloud XaaS : </h3>
<p>
In XaaS abbreviation, ‘X’ is a variable parameter that means the first symbol in the name of the additional cloud service. Due to it sometimes there are mismatches. Either different providers give the same products different names, or on the contrary, different products have the same abbreviation — e.g., MaaS may mean Monitoring-as-a-service for some providers, Metal-as-a-service for others providers, and Malware-as-a-Service for other ones.
<br>
<br>
Another example is about backup cloud service. Some of the providers call it BaaS, Backup-as-a-Service, but other ones call it RaaS, Recovery-as-a-Service, that help to backup critical information and recover it on demand.
<br>
<br>

It is impossible to cover the whole vast range of services offered by the XaaS market within one article, and there is no need. Very often, XaaS solution providers make their services based on the needs of a narrow client segment. But there are a number of services that are most popular and are used most often. We will consider them.

<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>BAAS — BACKUP-AS-A-SERVICE : </h3>

<p>
   This is one of the key points of corporate information security. Backup-as-a-Service allows you to make regular backups of data in the cloud and store them in remote storage. Remote storage of backups increases the resistance of information to various kinds of failures: even if the main system suffers from a cyber attack, natural disaster, and other acts-of-God, the data will survive. And after recovery from backups, the system will quickly return to working capacity.
   <br>
   <br>
SIM-Networks engineers developed and implemented in our cloud-based IaaS a specially adapted SIM-Cloud BaaS solution with excellent RTO and RPO. It is easily activated by the user from the cloud dashboard. Backup copies can be transferred to remote storage by two variants — either storage in the same Tier III+ data center where the main client infrastructure is deployed, or in Tier III+ data center remote from the main infrastructure. In the first case, the speed of data recovery is higher; in the second — the degree of data security increases further.
 <br>
 <br>
</p>

<h3>RAAS — RECOVERY-AS-A-SERVICE </h3>

<p>
	Sometimes RaaS is positioned as a stand-alone service from BaaS, more advanced in terms of data protection and application recovery speed. Some providers include it to the BaaS, often — associated with DRaaS.
	<br>
	<br>
We consider RaaS as a part of backup-as-a-service because we think it is illogical to separate data backup, storage, and data recovery into different services.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>DRAAS — DISASTER-RECOVERY-AS-A-SERVICE </h3>
<p>
	This complex service includes backup, recovery system tools, and full replication of all of the data, apps, and business processes. Actually, DRaaS clones the main infrastructure, and continuously updates it. In the case of a failure or disaster, the company’s work will continue in this additional infrastructure until the main system is restored. DRaaS is one of the main components of a business continuity strategy — BCM, Business Continuity Management.
	<br>
	<br>
Creating a redundant, fault-tolerant clone of the main infrastructure is a huge cost, unbearable for most companies. At the same time, cloud-based DRaaS is much more convenient, accessible, and provides additional protection delivered by the cloud provider.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>MAAS — MONITORING-AS-A-SERVICE : </h3>

<p>
	As a rule, large and technologically mature providers offer this service. The MaaS allows a user to control the key parameters of the cloud infrastructure, the load on applications, as well as the operation of software installed in the cloud. The purpose of this service is to reduce the risks of infrastructure failure and business downtime, process optimization. The prospect of developing this area in the future is directly related to Big Data.
	<br>
	<br>
The SIM-Cloud IaaS has a CloudMon monitoring service developed by SIM-Networks infrastructure engineers.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3> DBAAS — DATABASE-AS-A-SERVICE </h3>

<p>
	It is very popular, one of the key XaaS. It allows companies to access databases without having to set up infrastructure or software. Database administration and maintenance manages by the cloud provider, but the customer just uses the database as a product.

	<br>
	<br>

	<h3>EAAS — ENVIRONMENT-AS-A-SERVICE : </h3>

	<p>
		Sometimes this service names IaaS Plus, sometimes it’s considered as an intermediate version between the PaaS and IaaS models. The specifics of the Environment-as-a-Service is that the client receives the necessary environment for the development, testing, deployment of their applications, automated, integrated with the leading container solutions Kubernetes and Docker. EaaS solutions reduce cloud computing business costs, optimize infrastructure utilization, and increase performance.
	</p>

	<h3>BACKEND-AS-A-SERVICE : </h3>
	<p>

		In software development, the frontend means what the end-user sees in the browser or interface, and the back-end means the main functionality, everything that works on the server. In other words, the frontend is visualization, HTML with CSS and JavaScript, and the backend is the subsurface part of the iceberg: these are programming languages, interaction with databases. In programming web and mobile applications, the backend is responsible for interacting with the interface, storing and managing data, managing database queries, and displaying this information in a browser.
		<br>
		<br>
Backend-as-a-Service and mobile variation MBaaS is a cloud service that provides web developers with all the necessary environment and components, including cloud storage, databases, APIs.
