	<h1>What is intelligent process automation? </h1>

	<p>
		In essence, IPA “takes the robot out of the human.” At its core, IPA is an emerging set of new technologies that combines fundamental process redesign with robotic process automation and machine learning. It is a suite of business-process improvements and next-generation tools that assists the knowledge worker by removing repetitive, replicable, and routine tasks. And it can radically improve customer journeys by simplifying interactions and speeding up processes.
<br>
<br>

IPA mimics activities carried out by humans and, over time, learns to do them even better. Traditional levers of rule-based automation are augmented with decision-making capabilities thanks to advances in deep learning and cognitive technology. The promise of IPA is radically enhanced efficiency, increased worker performance, reduction of operational risks, and improved response times and customer journey experiences.

<h3>The value of IPA : </h3>
<p>
	While IPA takes over rote tasks, human workers can focus on delighting customers and thinking about how new troves of data outside the organization—from news, events, social media, embedded sensors, and elsewhere—can help achieve business goals.
<br>
<br>

Although the full range of benefits comes from implementing the complete IPA suite, companies can unlock significant value quickly through individual elements. RPA alone can drive significant productivity gains, as Exhibit 1 shows.
<br>
<br>

One large financial institution used an RPA transformation at scale to automate 60 to 70 percent of tasks in record-to-report processes and create annual run-rate efficiencies of 30 percent or more. Using the same methodology, another institution achieved an 80 percent reduction in processing costs in excess queue procedures. Yet another financial institution in the FT500 used robotics to unlock a £175 million annual reduction in costs and save over 120 FTEs.
<br>
<br>
In addition, IPA helps leaders get the most out of decades of investments in a multitude of complex systems and make many complicated decisions simultaneously. We have also seen businesses insert controls to activate additional processes triggered by new discoveries in real time. Creating an unsupervised machine-learning platform coupled with a natural-language generation engine, for example, will soon allow the processing of structured daily performance data to create deep insights that help leaders make better decisions, while shifting internal management processes at the same time. No longer will painful-to-create reports with limited functionality be required, only to pile up on desks. In the insurance industry particularly, there are areas where IPA could have massive impact.
</p>
<br>
<br>


<h3>How to get started on your IPA transformation : </h3>

<p>
	IPA does not require a significant infrastructure investment since it addresses the presentation layer of information systems. RPA software, for example, sits on top of existing systems, enabling it to be implemented to achieve rapid returns without changing the IT back end. In some cases, companies can get RPA systems up and running—and delivering value—in as little as two weeks.
<br>
<br>

In our experience, the following steps are the most important in driving successful IPA transformations at scale:

<br>
<br>

1. Rapidly align on IPA’s role in operating model<br>

Any effective IPA initiative must be grounded in a clear understanding of the overall strategy of the business and the role of the next-generation operating model in helping to achieve it. That requires a clear articulation of the target end state and the journeys to focus on to reach it. Such clarity allows business leaders to evaluate and align on the approaches and capabilities to implement to drive the operating model. In many cases IPA has an important—even dominant—role in driving the change, but its greatest value comes when companies understand how it can work with the other capabilities and approaches in the operating model. Automation is coming, and now is the time to define the art of the possible and apply it strategically where it makes most sense.

<br>
<br>

2. Design around the full portfolio of IPA solutions to maximize impact
Organizations should not dabble with a few IPA technologies. The world moves too quickly for that approach to work effectively. The full impact comes when IPA technologies work together.

Organizations need to envision and implement holistic optimization programs to maximize return on investment. Though it is easier and faster to implement automation projects in silos, such an approach is inherently flawed. By themselves, individual technologies are insufficient to capture value. Instead, fundamental process redesign is required to transform the way a group works.

A detailed roadmap for implementation should be created to identify all automation-enhancement opportunities and allow businesses to sequence IPA initiatives by balancing their impact with the feasibility of scaling solutions from initial use cases. Start your IPA journey by rapidly creating an overview of current tasks and the resources and capabilities needed to carry them out. Then deploy an experienced ring-fenced incubator team to redesign processes and group workflows based on a deep understanding of lines of business and IPA capabilities.

<br>
<br>
3. Build a rapid minimum viable product (MVP)
Even though it’s important to design for a full IPA portfolio, it can be daunting to start working on everything at once. Many executives have been burned by promising complex data-warehouse projects, some of which have taken up to a decade to complete and have run vastly over budget. As with other digitization efforts, it’s better to select—with a bias to speed and impact—an end-to-end process or customer journey to redesign and enhance using IPA, and then work to launch an MVP, the most stripped-down version of the product that can still accomplish the task. In this way, you can quickly test what works and what doesn’t and make changes accordingly.

<br>
<br>

IPA can deliver tangible value in weeks rather than years in the form of fewer errors and less “busy work” for back-office employees. The rapid returns from early pilots help to secure support from stakeholders and executive sponsors for a much deeper program to harness the potential achievable from a full IPA transformation.

<br>
<br>
4. Build momentum and capture value
Any IPA implementation should combine quick wins with larger longer-term developments. The detailed roadmap should be rooted in a fundamental process redesign that sequences automated modules for production and reimagines the way groups should work to capture value.

Every product line in insurance, for example, has a different degree of potential for standardization and automation, and needs to be examined and sequenced (Exhibit 2). Look at time-intensive processes in sales, underwriting and pricing, policy administration, claims and finance, and accounts, and start with a clean sheet when deciding how they will work in future.
