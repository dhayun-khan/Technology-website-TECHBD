	<h1> What is Hyperautomation?</h1>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p>
		Automation is the use of technology to perform work that originally required human action. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools (which your organization probably already used) made it easier to automate processes in the enterprise. At DataRobot, we partner with the leaders in the space, including UiPath, Automation Anywhere and BluePrism.
<br>

Historically organisations relied on complex code to automate work, but RPA made it much easier, democratizing coding. Bots now work like a person would, using user interfaces (UIs) of common applications like SAP, SalesForce and Microsoft Office. The main limitation with RPA is that it can only automate simple tasks – RPA needs processes to follow predefined rules with structured data.
<br>

<h3> Hyperautomation : </h3>
<br>
<p>
<b><mark> “Hyperautomation deals with the application of advanced technologies including AI and machine learning to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.” </mark></b>

<br>
<br>

We are excited about hyperautomation at DataRobot as it aligns to our vision of the future work, and how our customers are supplementing their RPA tools. If RPA democratized rules-based coding, DataRobot has democratized Artificial Intelligence (AI). This more intelligent automation is required to tackle end-to-end processes where people interpret data, make decisions and produce predictions.
<br>

Gartner views hyperautomation as an “unavoidable market state” as businesses must rapidly automate “all possible businesses processes” to remain competitive, with several implications that further explain the Hyperautomation trend:
<br>

1.The scope of automation changes. The focus will shift from simple rules-based tasks to knowledge work, with greater return on investment and more dynamic experiences.<br>
2.A range of tools will be used to manage work. RPA alone is no longer sufficient and  companies need machine learning.<br>

3.Architecting for agility is required. Organisations need to be able to quickly reconfigure processes as needs evolve, requiring agile working practices and tools.<br>
4.Workforce engagement is needed. Employees need to reinvent their operations to achieve greater impact, requiring cross-departmental initiatives and better use of partners.<br> 

</p>



<br>
<br>
<p>
	The role of machine learning is critical as it “explodes the range of hyperautomation possibilities”. It enables the automation of processes that were once deemed exclusively the domain of knowledge workers. Yet according to Gartner, the focus will not be on replacing these workers, but primarily on improving their ability to deliver value. Machine learning will also enable adaptive and intelligence processes, that executive the next best action, instead of the same repeatable sequence.
<br>
<br>

In subsequent blogs, we’ll explore hyperautomation in further detail, including the best use cases of this more intelligent automation that combines RPA and AI.

<h3>Historic evolution : </h3>
<br>
<p>
The typical benefits of robotic automation include reduced cost; increased speed, accuracy, and consistency; improved quality and scalability of production. Automation can also provide extra security, especially for sensitive data and financial services.
<br>
As a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of screen scraping, which can be traced back to early forms of malware. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of API integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into ITSM systems, terminal services and even some types of AI (e.g. Machine Learning) services such as image recognition. It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises[2] (who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation).
<br>
A principal barrier to the adoption of self-service is often technological: it may not always be feasible or economically viable to retro-fit new interfaces onto existing systems. Moreover, organisations may wish to layer a variable and configurable set of process rules on top of the system interfaces which may vary according to market offerings and the type of customer. This only adds to the cost and complexity of the technological implementation. Robotic automation software provides a pragmatic means of deploying new services in this situation, where the robots simply mimick the behaviour of humans to perform the back end transcription or processing. The relative affordability of this approach arises from the fact that no IT new transformation or investment is required; instead the software robots simply leverage greater use out of existing IT assets.	
<br>
<br>

<h3>Deployment : </h3>

<br>
<p>
	The hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a virtual environment and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of virtualization technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.
	<br>

There are however several risks with RPA. Criticism include risks of stifling innovation and creating a more complex maintenance environment of existing software that now needs to consider the use of graphical user interfaces in a way they weren't intended to be used.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Impact on employment : </h3>

<br>
<p>
	According to Harvard Business Review, most operations groups adopting RPA have promised their employees that automation would not result in layoffs.[5] Instead, workers have been redeployed to do more interesting work. One academic study highlighted that knowledge workers did not feel threatened by automation: they embraced it and viewed the robots as team-mates.[6] The same study highlighted that, rather than resulting in a lower "headcount", the technology was deployed in such a way as to achieve more work and greater productivity with the same number of people.
	<br>

Conversely, however, some analysts proffer that RPA represents a threat to the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.[7] The thesis behind this notion is that RPA will enable enterprises to "repatriate" processes from offshore locations into local data centers, with the benefit of this new technology. The effect, if true, will be to create high-value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations (and within the associated supply chain of IT hardware, data center management, etc.) but to decrease the available opportunity to low skilled workers offshore. On the other hand, this discussion appears to be healthy ground for debate as another academic study was at pains to counter the so-called "myth" that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore.

<b>Impact on society </b>
<p>
	Academic studies[8][9] project that RPA, among other technological trends, is expected to drive a new wave of productivity and efficiency gains in the global labour market. Although not directly attributable to RPA alone, Oxford University conjectures that up to 35% of all jobs might be automated by 2035.[8]<br>

There are geographic implications to the trend in robotic automation. In the example above where an offshored process is "repatriated" under the control of the client organization (or even displaced by a Business Process Outsourcer from an offshore location to a data centre, the impact will be a deficit in economic activity to the offshore location and an economic benefit to the originating economy. On this basis, developed economies – with skills and technological infrastructure to develop and support a robotic automation capability – can be expected to achieve a net benefit from the trend.<br>

In a TEDx talk[10] hosted by University College London (UCL), entrepreneur David Moss explains that digital labour in the form of RPA is not only likely to revolutionize the cost model of the services industry by driving the price of products and services down, but that it is likely to drive up service levels, quality of outcomes and create increased opportunity for the personalization of services.<br>

In a separate TEDx in 2019 talk,[11] Japanese business executive, and former CIO of Barclays bank, Koichi Hasegawa noted that digital robots can be a positive effect on society if we start using a robot with empathy to help every person. He provides a case study of the Japanese insurance companies – Sompo Japan and Aioi – both of whom deployed bots to speed up the process of insurance pay-outs in past massive disaster incidents.<br>

Meanwhile, Professor Willcocks, author of the LSE paper[9] cited above, speaks of increased job satisfaction and intellectual stimulation, characterising the technology as having the ability to "take the robot out of the human",[12] a reference to the notion that robots will take over the mundane and repetitive portions of people's daily workload, leaving them to be redeployed into more interpersonal roles or to concentrate on the remaining, more meaningful, portions of their day.<br>
